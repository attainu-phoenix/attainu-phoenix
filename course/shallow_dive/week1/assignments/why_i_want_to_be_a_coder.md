I want to learn coding because:

It sharpens my troubleshooting skills.
Helps me solve problems.
Makes me think.
It has helped me to be creative.
The rise in my technical skills gives me a sense of self reliance and empowerment.
It has made me patient.
Gives me the ability to understand people, their way of thinking.
Increases my vision.
I have become more productive and efficient.
I have started thinking about the consequences before i think about the benefits.
