<h1>Monish Ashok Manwani</h1>

<p>My basic philosophy about life is balance<br>while it is neccessary that one should change with time,<br> however one should tune a fine balance between aspects of <br>changing with time and his/her own beliefs and perceptions<br>
such that it does not have a negative impact on his/her thought process.</p>
