I worked in a service sector.  Although I liked my job,
I was always fascinated by software coding and wanted
to build something. This is a very creative field and
I hope it satisfies my appetite for creating/building
products.  I resigned from my job to take up this course
and I would like to work as a software developer building
websites or apps; however, at the core I want to be someone
who could work on his own projects or new ideas. So I want
to be very proficient and well versed with the software coding.
